# fMRI-face-reconstruction-VAE-GAN
Code and notebooks related to the paper: "Reconstructing Faces from fMRI Patterns using Deep Generative Neural Networks" by VanRullen &amp; Reddy, 2019
This folder contains:
* a link to download the fMRI datasets (4 subjects, each saw > 8,000 faces in the scanner)
* a set of Matlab functions to:
  * do this
  * do that
  * and so many other things
* a set of .py functions for the VAE-GAN face decomposition model
* together with a .ipynb notebook showing examples of usage
