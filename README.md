# fMRI-face-reconstruction-VAE-GAN
Code and notebooks related to the paper: "Reconstructing Faces from fMRI Patterns using Deep Generative Neural Networks" by VanRullen &amp; Reddy, 2019

This folder contains:
* a link to download the fMRI datasets (4 subjects, each saw > 8,000 faces in the scanner) and some Matlab analysis code
* a set of .py functions for the VAE-GAN face decomposition/reconstruction model
* together with a .ipynb notebook showing examples of usage
